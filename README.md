# quorum-on-k8s
Learning more about blockchain by deploying Kaleido's Quorum and sample Racecourse app on Kubernetes.

## Getting Started

### Requirements

* minikube >= 1.16.0
* docker >= 20.0.0
* helm >= 3.0.0

### Setup

First get a Kuberentes cluster provisioned, `minikube` is always an easy option:

```bash
# assumes bash on linux or macos
make k8s
```

> **Note**: It's recommended to login to GHCR for Docker and Kubernetes to avoid throttling:

```bash
./hack/configure-ghcr.sh ${gh_personal_token} ${gh_username}
```

Then if you'd like to build and host your own images on GitHub Container Registry (GHCR):

```bash
# assumes you have git installed and have docker login'ed to ghcr.io
make build
```

However, images are already available for [`ghcr.io/hfuss`](https://github.com/users/hfuss/packages?repo_name=quorum-on-k8s).

### Development

Right now, development consists of iterating on the Quorum chart:

```bash
# deploys the chart
make deploy

# currently allows you to view the contents of the config PVC to debug the autogenerated config
make test

# delete the helm release and cleanup hook up resources
make clean
```
