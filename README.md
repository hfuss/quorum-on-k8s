# quorum-on-k8s
Learning more about blockchain by deploying Kaleido's Quorum and sample Racecourse app on Kubernetes.

## Getting Started

### Requirements

* minikube >= 1.16.0
* docker >= 20.0.0
* helm >= 3.0.0

### Setup

First get a Kuberentes cluster provisioned, `minikube` is always an easy option:

```bash
# assumes bash on linux or macos
make k8s
```

Then make sure you have the quorum-tools' container images built and ideally pushed:

```bash
# assumes you have git installed and have docker login'ed to ghcr.io
./hack/build-images.sh
```

### Development

Right now, development consists of iterating on the Quorum chart:

```bash
# deploys the chart
make deploy

# currently allows you to view the contents of the config PVC to debug the autogenerated config
make test

# delete the helm release and cleanup hook up resources
make clean
```
